# WBSM4
This repo implements basic operations for matrices over the binary field using Java, including matrix inversion, rank calculation, matrix multiplication, matrix-vector multiplication, and the generation of random invertible matrices. These functionalities can aid in the construction of white-box implementations. As an example, this project has implemented the Xiao-Lai white-box SM4 scheme based on the aforementioned matrix operations, solely for the purpose of research on white-box cryptographic security.
